Bio
======

I am currently a PhD Candidate in Sociology at New York University. I use computational and historical methods to study politics, culture, and social policy. I received my B.A. in Sociology from National Taiwan University (2021).


Research
======

My dissertation focuses on how U.S. politicians use "budget talk," namely discourse around budget deficits, government debt, and saving taxpayer money, to discuss, challenge, and justify public policies in the last hundred years.
